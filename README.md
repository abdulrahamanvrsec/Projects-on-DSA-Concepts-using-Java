# 📌 Projects-on-DSA-Concepts-using-Java

Welcome to **Projects on DSA Concepts using Java**!  
This repository contains multiple Java-based projects, from core data structures and algorithms (DSA) to GUI-based applications. Each project helps reinforce key programming concepts through real-world logic and clean user interfaces.

## 🚀 Projects Overview

### 1️⃣ Project Launcher (GUI-Based)
A GUI-based launcher that allows users to run different Java projects from one interface.

**Features:**
- ✅ Interactive GUI using Swing
- ✅ Easy navigation across projects
- ✅ One-click execution

---

### 2️⃣ Snake Game (Swing & AWT)
A classic snake game built using Java Swing and AWT.

**Features:**
- ✅ Smooth pixel-based snake movement
- ✅ Real-time score tracking
- ✅ Collision detection (walls and self)

---

### 3️⃣ File Compression (Huffman Encoding)
Compress and decompress files using Huffman encoding.

**Features:**
- ✅ Huffman Tree data structure
- ✅ File compression/decompression logic
- ✅ GUI for file selection

---

### 4️⃣ Cash Flow Minimizer (Graph Algorithm)
Optimizes payments among friends to minimize the total number of transactions.

**Features:**
- ✅ Uses Graphs and Heaps
- ✅ Net balance calculation
- ✅ Greedy settlement of debts

---

### 5️⃣ Sudoku Solver (Backtracking Algorithm)
Solves standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles using recursive backtracking.

**Features:**
- ✅ Real-time solution display
- ✅ Backtracking logic
- ✅ Simple Swing interface

---

### 6️⃣ 🗺️ Map Navigator (Dijkstra’s Algorithm)
A path-finding GUI application that calculates the shortest route between two locations using **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**.

**Features:**
- ✅ Interactive GUI to input start and end locations
- ✅ Calculates and displays the shortest path
- ✅ Uses **Graph** and **Priority Queue** internally
- ✅ Helps visualize pathfinding via Dijkstra’s logic

---

## 📜 Requirements

- ✔ Java JDK 8 or higher
- ✔ IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code
- ✔ (Optional) External JARs if needed for GUI enhancements
